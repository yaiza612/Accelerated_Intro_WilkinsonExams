Mutant seeds were usually desiccation tolerant at maturity, although their viability was reduced slightly after several weeks of storage. Dry seeds often germinated to produce seedlings with distorted cotyledons. This defect resulted from degeneration of cotyledon tips prior to germination. Some trichomes form on cotyledons after germination and stomata are found on surface of cotyledons of mutant embryos The cotyledon surface on seedlings produced from dry seeds lacked trichomes (likely because any trichomes initiated during embryogenesis did not survive desiccation).
